parameters:
    species: "hg38" # Name of species. If you specify the parameter "index_primary" in config.yml, then it should be the same name here
    genome_size: None # Currently, we only include genome size of hg38 and mm39, you can use this parameter to set genome sizes of other species. 
    condition: "SCC4KO" # The condition you want to calculate frips (Don't include parenthese). If you set it to "all", then all conditions' frip values will be generated. You can find a specific condition name in metadata generated by fetch_metadata.py
    peak_protein: "CTCF" # Specify which proteins peak you want to calculate frip values base on 
    nproc: 49 # Number of Cpus you want to use

input:
    path_to_metadata: "/home1/yxiao977/sc1/test_frip_sm_data/frip_result/Haarhuis_2017/metadata.txt" # Path to metadata generated by fetch_metadata.py, which you can find in fetch_metadata_config.yml
    path_to_data: "/home1/yxiao977/proj/frip_sm_data/ChIP_fastqs_maps/Haarhuis_2017/" # Path to output directory of snakemake, which you can find in config.yml
    path_to_bed: "" # Path to a specific peak bed file you want to use for calculating frip values. By default, you don't need to change this parameter, as the path will be automatically fetched, unless you want to try different combinations

output:
    output_directory: "/scratch1/yxiao977/test_frip_sm_data/frip_result/Haarhuis_2017/"
