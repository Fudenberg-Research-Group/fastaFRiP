Rini peak file creation:


For calling peaks and generating a consensus peaklist:
(1) Using MACS2, call peaks in each replicate of Rad21 paired with input separately.
(2) Convert excel outputs with width of peaks to bed files.
(3) Use bedtools multiinter to get all intervals and how many replicates cover them.
Take the intervals covered by at least 3 (or whatever) replicates. Most will be narrower than the peak called in any individual replicate.
Also make an upset plot to get an idea of how reproducible the peaks are overall.
(4) To get more accurate peak widths: Call peaks on all replicates combined and filter for only the ones that overlap a peak from the consensus list but keep the width from the combined peak calls.
(5) Remove blacklisted regions.
